游닄 **Code-Knowledge-Log: Tracking My Development Growth**

Welcome to my personal development repository! This log is a testament to my commitment to continuous learning and mastery of programming.<br>
<br>
This repository serves as a chronological and structured record of my journey through various programming languages, fundamental computer science concepts, frameworks, and related technologies.<br>

游눹 **Languages and Technologies in Focus**<br>
Here are the technologies currently being documented, spanning from core backend logic to modern frontend development:<br>

**Tier 1: Core Fundamentals**<br>
!- C++	Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Classes, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Low-Level Data Structures.	游릭 In Progress <br>
!- Python	Scripting and Backend Logic: Syntax, Data Structures, and preparing for specialized libraries.	游리 Starting<br>
!- JavaScript (JS)	Core Language: ES6+ syntax, asynchronous programming, and DOM manipulation.	游리 Starting<br>

**Tier 2: Web Development Stack**<br>
!- HTML & Tailwind CSS	Frontend Structure & Styling: Semantic HTML and utility-first CSS methodology.	游리 Planning<br>
!- React	Frontend Framework: Component-based architecture, state management, and hooks.	游리 Planning<br>
!- Node.js	Backend Environment: Server-side JavaScript, Express framework, and REST APIs.	游리 Planning<br>
!- Other Technologies	Databases (SQL/NoSQL), Git/GitHub Workflow, etc.	游리 Planning<br>

游빐 **Repository Structure**<br>
Each main directory corresponds to a programming language or major concept. Within each folder, you will typically find:<br>

`NOTES.md`: Detailed explanations of key syntax, concepts, and challenges encountered.<br>
`Exercises/`: Small, focused code snippets used to practice specific features.<br>
`Projects/`: Larger, integrated projects demonstrating combined knowledge.<br>

Thank you for visiting! Feel free to explore the code and notes.
